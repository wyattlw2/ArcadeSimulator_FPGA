To start the game, switch 0 must be flipped to a high position. The default "title screen" is a panel of sidesteppers. To control the player character, a USB keyboard is required. The player character can be moved in the cardinal directions corresponding to the A and D keys, and pressing spacebar will make the character jump. Running the game involves appropriate setup in Quartus and requires using the DE-10 Lite.

If you have memory instantiation errors, go to "Assignments -> Devices -> Configurations" and change the image compression settings to allow for memory initialization in the on-chip memory.
